Welcome to my Stream.Me addon for KODI

This is my first attempt at both Python and KODI plugins. I hope you get some use out of it. Feel free to feedback any suggestions and/or code improvements.

You will need a http://stream.me account - and need to have followed some other streamers

Instructions:

* Install the add-on
* Set your stream.me user name. You can get this from the Stream.Me website. Open the settings for your account. DO NOT use the Display Name.

By default the username is set to winsomehax (my account). The addon accesses the stream.me site to get the list of streamers you follow.

NOTE: This isn't a security issue/problem. You can see who other users are following via the stream.me website. 

Open the addon and it will show a top level menu:

1) Set your stream.me username
2) Live streams by followed users
3) Archived streams by followed userss
4) All live streams

Option 1 will open the settings dialog where you can set your stream.me username
Option 2 will list all the live streams running by the users you are following. This may be empty if none of your followed users are streaming.
Option 3 will list all the Stream.Me users you are following. Selecting a user will then list all of their archived streams.
Option 4 will list all the currently running live streams on stream.me - could be a long list

Once you have a list of streams, select one and... enjoy watching.
